This repository exists for self-learning purposes and for those who may be interested. Just like its "Doing Bayesian Data Analysis" counterpart, it contains implementations of Stata code in Python from Cunningham's Causal Inference (the mixtape). If you have no clue about the Mixtape go to https://mixtape.scunning.com.

Please note that the data presented in the book will naturally differ from what's on the scripts. This is because the Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) from stata is different from Python's (NumPy).

One final word: if you find some mistakes, it's on me :), not on Cunningham. I'd be happy to learn from it.
