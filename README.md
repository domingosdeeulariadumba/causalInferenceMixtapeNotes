This repository exists for self-learning purposes and for those who may be interested. Just like its "Doing Bayesian Data Analysis" counterpart, it contains implementations of Stata code in Python from Cunningham's Causal Inference (the mixtape). If you have no clue about the Mixtape go to https://mixtape.scunning.com.

### How to run the scripts?
So far, I've used four dependencies: NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn. In case you're not familiar with Python, I recommend you to get started via Anaconda (as it handles the basics, and brings the five aforementioned packages by default). You can also get Python separately from your OS Store, install it, and just run the command below on your terminal:

**`pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn`**

Or simply use Google Colab (no installation headache).

### About the differences on generated data
Please note that the data presented in the book will naturally not match what you will obtain by running the scripts. This is because Stata's Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) differs from Python's (NumPy).

### One final word
Just like AI, I can make mistakes, with the only obvious difference being that I am a person. If you find any, they're on me :), not on Cunningham. I'd be happy to learn from it.
